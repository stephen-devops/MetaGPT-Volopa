Knowledge":"All models use UUID primary keys. Multi-tenant architecture requires client_id filtering on all queries. Status enum values: draft, validating, validation_failed, awaiting_approval, approved, processing, completed, failed. CSV validation uses league/csv package. Authentication integrates with existing Volopa OAuth2/WSSE system. All monetary values stored as decimal(15,2). File upload limit is 10,000 rows per file.","Anything UNCLEAR":"OAuth2 provider configuration details for Volopa platform integration need clarification. Purpose of Payment codes structure and validation rules by country/currency combinations require definition. Real-time notification system implementation approach (WebSocket vs polling) should be determined. Specific approval workflow hierarchy rules and auto-approval thresholds need definition. Integration specifications for existing Volopa beneficiary management and payment processing APIs required."}
