  "Shared Knowledge": "All controllers follow thin controller pattern with FormRequest validation and Policy authorization. Services contain business logic with DB transactions. API Resources transform model data. Queue jobs handle async processing for large files. Models use UUID primary keys and client_id scoping. All lists are paginated. Currency-specific validation rules are centralized in CsvValidationService.",
  "Anything UNCLEAR": "OAuth2/WSSE authentication middleware integration with existing Volopa auth services needs specification. Currency-specific approval rules matrix and threshold amounts require definition. Real-time bell notification delivery mechanism (WebSocket vs polling) needs clarification. Foreign key relationships between existing models (TccAccount, Beneficiary) and new tables need detailed mapping. File storage strategy (local, S3, database) for uploaded CSV files needs specification."
